1.) What this form is to for is to create a new account using Name, Email, and Password 

2.) List of input and validation are
  - Name which requires atleast 2 characters
  - Email which requires it to be in email format
  - Password which requires atleast 8 characters

3.) How the feedback apears is if you submit without completing the requirements it will give you an error on the specific inputs you messed up. If they are correct when first trying to submit it will go away.
If you submit it successfully it will let you know the form was submitted 

4.) The devTools insight used was that you can see in the console that we intercepted the submission and confirm it was sent
